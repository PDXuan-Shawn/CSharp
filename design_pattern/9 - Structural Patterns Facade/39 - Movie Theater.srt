2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
<font color="#b1b1b1">Flashlight design pattern is provide a unified interface to set off interfaces</font>

3
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:16,384
<font color="#e8e8e8">Define higher level interface</font>

4
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:19,968
<font color="#c5c5c5">That makes the subsystem easier to us</font>

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,528
<font color="#a4a4a4">Last year was that simple example</font>

6
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:28,672
<font color="#dbdbdb">Complex subsystem for operating at home theater</font>

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,048
<font color="#e8e8e8">That might be individual components like amplifier</font>

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,144
<font color="#efefef">DVD player projector Etc</font>

9
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,960
<font color="#cacaca">Instead of having the client code</font>

10
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,032
<font color="#f6f6f6">Interact with each component separately</font>

11
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,664
<font color="#939393">Just like the interaction</font>

12
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,712
<font color="#afafaf">Here's</font>

13
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,504
<font color="#f1f1f1">We can call</font>

14
00:00:54,528 --> 00:01:00,672
<font color="#c7c7c7">First the latest the Fine Art Classes we have a amplifier okay</font>

15
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:06,048
<font color="#bcbcbc">On the amplifier last I have some metals less implement the methods</font>

16
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:12,448
<font color="#c7c7c7">We have a public what is on the method and is on method we are simulating the behavior</font>

17
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,728
<font color="#bcbcbc">We are like the others</font>

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,800
<font color="#8e8e8e">Is consolidate right line</font>

19
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,944
<font color="#ececec">Amplifier</font>

20
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,016
<font color="#ebebeb">Amplifier is on</font>

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,904
<font color="#e2e2e2">Okay then we have another one let's make this uppercase</font>

22
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,952
<font color="#bdbdbd">It has the best practice</font>

23
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,768
<font color="#b0b0b0">Employment last three</font>

24
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,840
<font color="#b5b5b5">Three method for</font>

25
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,424
<font color="#dadada">Second I want to set set volume</font>

26
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,264
<font color="#dbdbdb">On this set volume is setting volume</font>

27
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,568
<font color="#989898">So let's say</font>

28
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,360
<font color="#dcdcdc">Let's get that level here</font>

29
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,664
<font color="#a7a7a7">Because we are setting</font>

34
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,768
<font color="#bababa">We are setting volume</font>

35
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,752
<font color="#eeeeee">Okay and the last one is amplifier</font>

36
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:25,152
<font color="#c2c2c2">Instead of on off and let's say amplifier is off</font>

37
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:31,552
<font color="#8a8a8a">Okay I'll let you set seconds left to say</font>
