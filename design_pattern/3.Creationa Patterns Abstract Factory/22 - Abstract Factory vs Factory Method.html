<p><strong>Factory Method vs Abstract Factory 🤔🔍</strong></p><p>Both <strong>Factory Method</strong> and <strong>Abstract Factory</strong> are creational design patterns 📐 that deal with the process of object creation. However, they serve different needs and have distinct characteristics.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Factory Method 🏭</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Single Product</strong>: Focuses on creating one type of product. 👤🛠️</p></li><li><p><strong>Subclassing</strong>: Defines an interface but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. 🔄📦</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Case</strong>: Useful when a class can’t anticipate the class of objects it must create. 🤷‍♂️🛠️</p></li><li><p><strong>Example</strong>: A single <code><strong>CarFactory</strong></code> that produces a <code><strong>Car</strong></code> but can be subclassed to produce specialized cars like <code><strong>Sedan</strong></code>, <code><strong>SUV</strong></code>, etc. 🚗🚙</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Abstract Factory 🏭🔀</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Family of Products</strong>: Concerned with the creation of a family of related or dependent products. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🛠️</p></li><li><p><strong>Interfaces for Factories</strong>: Defines an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. 📦🔀</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Case</strong>: Useful when the system needs to be independent from how its objects are created, composed, and represented. 🔄📦</p></li><li><p><strong>Example</strong>: A <code><strong>VehicleFactory</strong></code> that can produce both <code><strong>Car</strong></code> and <code><strong>Bike</strong></code> objects, with variations like <code><strong>Sedan</strong></code>, <code><strong>SUV</strong></code>, <code><strong>MountainBike</strong></code>, <code><strong>RoadBike</strong></code>, etc. 🚗🚲</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Similarities 😃</strong></p><ul><li><p>Both aim to separate object creation from its use. 🔄🛠️</p></li><li><p>Both promote loose coupling between classes. 🔗👍</p></li></ul><p><strong>Differences 😕</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Scope</strong>: Factory Method is more focused (single responsibility), whereas Abstract Factory is more generalized (multiple responsibilities). 🔍📦</p></li><li><p><strong>Complexity</strong>: Abstract Factory is generally more complex to implement due to multiple product types. 🤯🔀</p></li></ul><p><strong>When to Use Which? 🤷‍♂️</strong></p><ul><li><p>Use <strong>Factory Method</strong> when you have a single type of object to create and you want to extend the factory to produce different types of that object. 🏭👤</p></li><li><p>Use <strong>Abstract Factory</strong> when you have multiple types of related objects that you want to produce, and you want to ensure that the created objects can work together as a family. 🏭👨‍👩‍👧‍👦</p></li></ul><p><br></p>
