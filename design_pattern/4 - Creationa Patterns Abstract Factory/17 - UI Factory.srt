<font color="#cacaca">Wet abstract Factory pattern</font>

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,728
<font color="#dcdcdc">The abstract Factory pattern</font>

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,288
<font color="#ececec">Is a creation of design pattern</font>

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:18,688
<font color="#e7e7e7">That provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent</font>

6
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,784
<font color="#bfbfbf">We thought specifying their concrete crosses</font>

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,064
<font color="#b3b3b3">That's actually</font>

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:30,720
<font color="#e0e0e0">It involves multiple Factory methods and one for each type of object to</font>

9
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:37,632
<font color="#a9a9a9">Like the fact that I'm at pattern unless you is real or an example to demonstrate this and suppose you are designing</font>

10
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:41,472
<font color="#aeaeae">Can you also interface tool kit on you want to support</font>

11
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,520
<font color="#ebebeb">Different times or</font>

12
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:50,176
<font color="#c7c7c7">Like Lifetime on dark time you most probably familiar with this light and dark time concept</font>

13
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:54,016
<font color="#e1e1e1">Each time will have its own version of compounds right</font>

14
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,832
<font color="#a9a9a9">Like such as bottoms and windows</font>

15
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256
<font color="#dbdbdb">Create our product interfaces like the factory method or product</font>

00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:08,096
<font color="#b7b7b7">Is there facilities is important right and we have</font>

17
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:14,496
<font color="#cbcbcb">Button productive interface and we can create that public interface</font>

18
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:22,176
<font color="#d0d0d0">I button right we are creating interfaces with</font>

26
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,008
<font color="#d7d7d7">So we need an interface for</font>

36
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:26,176
<font color="#d3d3d3">Dark time compounds right how we can do that let's firstly create a public</font>

44
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,288

45
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,896
<font color="#ededed">Are interface because it is a concrete clause and if you</font>
